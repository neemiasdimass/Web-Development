    <h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
      Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
      technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
      appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

      "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either
      within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental
      aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
      pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the
      World Wide Web.
